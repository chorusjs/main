main.chorus.js
==============

Chorus.js is an API orchestration engine running on the Meteor/Node/MongoDB stack (M&M). It is so light weight that there is actually no engine. CORDs (Chorus.js Orchestration Definitions) are generated as simple node applications or modules. The orchestration data store is readily accessible to the app if necessary.  

Our emphasis is on delivering an orchestration capability that everyone can use. Chorus.js is easy to learn and integrate in your solution.
